### Data Quality

The Data Quality and Plausibility Report serves as a crucial tool for assessing the reliability and accuracy of the data collection of all related public health indicators across different assessments. This comprehensive analysis is designed to identify and address potential issues within the data, ensuring that field teams are being informed on potential issues detected in the data collection. 

The report provides a detailed examination of the datasets, employing a variety of metrics and methodologies to evaluate data quality and plausibility. This includes checks for completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data collected. This report aims to uncover any discrepancies, outliers, or anomalies that may suggest data collection, entry errors, or underlying issues that could impact the integrity of the findings.

<li> Check 3:Respondent reported wrong dates leading to a negative person time. </li>
</ul>
#### Mortality Section (Household Level)

<strong>Follow-Up Checks</strong>
<ul>
<li> Check 1: Respondent reported more than 2 death in the HH. </li>
</ul>
#### What to do next?

Please check the files in the output/ folder. The cleaning_logbook.xlsx already can contain some of the directly cleaned data. The followup_request.xlsm file represent the checks that needs to be followed up with the field team. Please follow the instruction in the READ_ME tab to know how to fill the file.
After filling the file, you can merge the [uuid/variable/old.value/new.value/issue] from the filled file with the cleaning_logbook.xlsx and add them to your cleaning scripts.

### Descriptive Analysis

The Descriptive Analysis is an analytical platform that presents a multitude of quantitative data tables. It encompasses a wide range of public health indicators collected through the assessment process, empowering users to examine and interpret complex datasets effectively. This tool is structured to support understanding the distribution of your data and support you writing your factsheets/outputs/reports, and create other visualizations.

#### FSL Section

As you saw in the output folder, you will have another excel file outputed from the analysis script.
<ul>
<li> The Excel file includes 2 sheets. The first 2 are all the tables that you see in the different sections of this HTML output. You can navigate to respective tables through the first sheet "Table of Contents". </li>
<li> Another output as well will include the IPC table.</li>
</ul>

#### Mortality Section

As you saw in the output folder, you will have another excel file outputed from the analysis script.
<ul>
<li>The Excel file includes 2 sheets. The first 2 are all the tables that you see in the different sections of this HTML output. You can navigate to respective tables through the first sheet "Table of Contents".</li>
</ul>

### IPHRA

The use case for this toolkit is intended to be in acute crises where there is a realistic possibility of deterioration of public health outcomes in the population to be assessed. This is not intended to be an urgent rapid assessment done within the first 72 hours, which tend to be more qualitative, but instead the intended timeline should be after an initial stabilization of a situation and population movements, maybe one month after an initial shock or hazard, depending on the situation. The general objective and purpose of an IPHRA assessment is “to assess the severity of the public health situation and identify initial public health priorities for response to mitigate excess morbidity, malnutrition, and mortality.”

Please follow the instructions provided in the recorded training sessions in the <a href = "https://acted.sharepoint.com/sites/IMPACT-Public_health/SitePages/Toolkits.aspx">PHU Intranet Page</a> to learn how to run the scripts. 

#### Quality Report and Plausibility Checks

The Data Quality and Plausibility Report serves as a crucial tool for assessing the reliability and accuracy of the IPHRA data collection across different sectors such as Nutrition, Mortality, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Food Security, and Livelihoods. This comprehensive analysis is designed to identify and address potential issues within the data, ensuring that field teams are being informed on potential issues detected in the data collection.\n\nFor each of these sectors, the report provides a detailed examination of the datasets, employing a variety of metrics and methodologies to evaluate data quality and plausibility. This includes checks for completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data collected. This report aims to uncover any discrepancies, outliers, or anomalies that may suggest data collection, entry errors, or underlying issues that could impact the integrity of the findings.

#### Cleaning

The IPHRA Cleaning toolkit is a tailored project to clean the collected data following IMPACT's guidance of quantitative data cleaning. The project is divided in batches files that can be ran outside of R Studio to reduce the interactions with R and allow any person run the scripts. You are required to have R Tools and RStudio installed on your device to be able to run the scripts.

#### Analysis

The IPHRA Tabular Analysis is an analytical platform that presents a multitude of quantitative data tables. It encompasses a wide range of indicators collected through the IPHRA assessment process, empowering users to examine and interpret complex datasets effectively. This tool is structured to support understanding the distribution of your data and support you writing your factsheets/outputs/reports, and create other visualizations. 

## Potential Errors and How to fix them

During the run of the integrated projects, some errors might occur. <br> Please see some of these errors that were already caught and the way to solve them. 

### lazy-load Error

![Lazy Load Error](./man/figures/just_restart.png)
This error usually appears after the scripts taking some time (5-10 mins) to load due to the upload of the packages. <br>
To solve this issue, only restart the session or R by going to the tab part -> Session -> Restart R (or CTRL + SHIFT + F10), and rerun the script again. 

### 'make' not found

![make not found](./man/figures/make_error.png)
This error usually appears during the installation of packages the first time you are running the scripts. The projects are wrapped within something called R Environment that automatically install and load the necessary packages for the project. Some of these packages are constantly maintained by their owners and new versions are deployed regularly. The script try to check for any updates in the package and upload the newest. However, if the error still shows, specially with <strong>Error: Error Installing package 'XXXX'</strong>, you have two options. 
<ul>
<li>If you are comfortable handling some debugging, please try to find the latest version of the mentioned package in the error in the web, usually searching (PACKAGE NAME latest version in r) show you something called the CRAN where you can see the latest version. Then, open renv.lock, and target the actual package (attention, not where it is mentioned as dependency to another package), then replace the version with the latest one. Please do contact Abraham Azar (abraham.azar@impact-initiatives) or the PHU team (impact.geneva.phu@impact-initiatives.org) mentioning the updated package name and the version.</li>
<li>If the first point was gibberish to you, directly contact Abraham Azar (abraham.azar@impact-initiatives) or the PHU team (impact.geneva.phu@impact-initiatives.org) with the error.</li>
</ul>

If any other error is hindering you to run the whole script, or any other semantic issues (output do not make any sense), please contact Abraham Azar (abraham.azar@impact-initiatives) or the PHU team (impact.geneva.phu@impact-initiatives.org) with the error/issue.
